# Mapping_Earthquakes
 
## Overview of the Analysis:

Interactive maps using the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Using the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world.

## Resources

**Data Source:** Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON.

**Software:** JavaScript, HTML, Git_Hub.

## Results:

#### Deliverable 1

-The tectonic plate data is added as a second layer group.

-The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object.

-The d3.json() callback is working and does the following: 

  *The tectonic plate data is passed to the geoJSON() layer.

  *The geoJSON() layer adds color and width to the tectonic plate lines.

  *The tectonic layer group variable is added to the map.

-The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displayed on the map when the page load.

#### Deliverable 2

-The major earthquake data is added as a third layer group.

-The major earthquake data is added to the overlay object.

-The d3.json() callback is working and does the following:

  *Sets the color and diameter of each earthquake.
  
  *The major earthquake data is passed to the geoJSON() layer.
  
  *The geoJSON() layer creates a circle for each major earthquake, and adds a popup for each circle to display the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
  
  *The major earthquake layer group variable is added to the map.
  
-All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off.

#### Deliverable 3

-A third map tile layer is created.

-The third map is added to the overlay object.

-All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the all maps of the webpage.

## Summary

The Analysis shows earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a third map.
